# kAuth

> Prefer composability over customizability.

kAuth is essentially a collection of independent and composable packages to provide the easiest authentication setup you've never seen before. Each discrete flow, component, route, or page of the authentication process is implemented in a separate package so the developer can pick and choose exactly what they need to provide the authentication platform required for their specific case. kAuth aims to make setup, customization, and configuration as simple as possible by opting to use a system of small and single-purpose driven packages that require minimal configuration to use.

## Getting Started

## Why choose kAuth?
The primary goal of kAuth is to provide an easy and fast development period, so if that's what you're looking for, you've came to the right place. Additionally, the following should highlight some key points of kAuth:
* Most kAuth packages (thus features) can be added to a project in 1-5 lines of code in nearly all cases.
* kAuth is powered by JSON Web Tokens and `Secure,HttpOnly` cookies to achieve a secure, reliable industry-standard approach to authentication.
